## TO USE MY ENVIRONMENT USING yaml.file

To run applications in folders named CaseStudy;

First of all, environment settings are made to avoid getting errors related to package compatibility. In order for you to do this easily, the environment.yaml file has been prepared.

Firstly, the following code is run on the terminal to return to the base environment from the environment you are in.

    conda deactivate

Then, the ready environment is installed by running the code below in the terminal.

    conda env create -f environment.yaml 

and finally the installed environment is activated.

    conda activate fero_s_swamp
